[WIP] Tool that reports armor with duplicate perks

Hey guys I've been out of the scene for a while quietly enjoying DIM and DIM Beta as a great and robust tool to manage your inventory. The only problem I had was that I don't have a very good way to manage what armor perks I have and don't have. So I created a NodeJs script that will process the output armor file that DIM produces and create a report that shows you what armor you can safely dismantle based on a few principles outlined below.

[Duplicate Perks]
- So let's suppose you have a piece of armor that has Shotgun/Hand Cannon Loader + Special/Heavy Ammo Finder
- That means the armor piece can have 4 different combinations:
SG Loader + SA Finder, HC Loader + SA Finder, HC Loader + HA Finder and SG Loader + HA Finder
- The script can find anywhere from 1 to 4 other pieces of armor that can create that combination
- The idea is that if you have other armor that can do what those perks are then you don't really need it

[Unwanted Perks]
- This part is subjective and can be freely modified, I created a list of perks that I think are useless in the overall scheme of things or not that useful that it warrants having it included in every combination.
//these archetypes have plenty of ammo so very rare to need to scavenge/reserve it
"Auto Rifle Scavenger", "Pulse Rifle Scavenger", "Scout Rifle Scavenger",
"Auto Rifle Reserves", "Pulse Rifle Reserves", "Scout Rifle Reserves",
//I rarely do melee as a hunter so remove those perks
"Impact Induction", "Light Reactor", "Invigoration", 
//Bows don't need reload speed improvements, plenty of ammo so no need to buff that either
"Bow Reloader", "Bow Reserves", "Arrow Scavenger",
//who needs to really aim these anyway?
"Unflinching Grenade Launcher Aim", "Unflinching Power Aim",
//Primary Ammo is already plentiful only very specific cases where you'd run out of bricks
"Primary Ammo Finder",
//making a spec that affects all Power weapons that are rarely used seems like a waste
"Unflinching Power Aim", "Power Dexterity"
- So for example if the armor piece has Primary Ammo Finder (PAF) and AR Scavenger then it's considered a piece that has no good combinations.

[Impossible Perks]
- There are 3 weapon types as of now that can only exist in the Heavy slot.
- Linear Fusion Rifles, Rocket Launchers and Swords.
- If you have a piece of armor that has let's say Fusion Rifle Loader + Sword Scavenger then that's an impossible perk combination
- It's considered impossible because you can't have both weapon types equipped at the same time
- The script finds combinations that are impossible and removes them from consideration as something you'd want
- The idea is if the armor piece has no wanted combinations then it's no use

[Redundant Perks]
- Let's pretend you have Light Arms Loader + SA Finder
- Let's also pretend you have HC Loader + SA Finder, SMG Loader + SA Finder and Sidearm Loader + SA Finder
- That means you don't need Light Arms Loader because you have the specific one that's better than the generic one, greater increased benefit means you don't need to keep the lesser one around.
- The script knows what the generic and the specific types are and looks for groups of specific + corresponding 2nd column perk to suggest you dismantle the generic version + 2nd column perk.

[Raid and Dreaming City Enhanced Armor]
- There is a few special conditions for these armor sets because they drop with 5 perks instead of 4 and because they can drop with enhanced versions of certain perks.
- For example if you have Enhanced HC Loader + SA Finder then you don't need any armor that has HC Loader + SA Finder because you have the better version already.
- I have a goal of eventually having only 5-perk armor sets in an effort to reduce the amount of space each piece takes by optimizing with the 5th perk and by having every enhanced version of the perk 
- The script never suggests a deletion of any 5 perk armor with that thought in mind.
- This is a limitation and a feature because theoretically you can have 2 5-perk armor pieces that share the same perks therefore one of them is a duplicate, I'll remove this line once that is improved.

[Unique Clause]
- For the sake of bounties and collections I made it so that no matter how bad or how duplicate the item is, if it's the only one of it's kind it won't be suggested for deletion.
- The idea here is to have a full armor set of everything in case the need arises to have to wear it for a quest.

[Caveats]
- This tool does not take into consideration the mobility/recovery/resillience aspect of the armor
- Also does not take into consideration the damage resistance of that armor
- This tool will not warn you when you are possibly deleting a unique combination, it suggests deletion assuming you're not going to delete anything else. It doesn't keep track of what it's suggesting you delete therefore it might suggest you to delete two different pieces that have a unique combination of perks.
For example let's pretend you have two pieces of armor that rolled with:
Armor #1: Shotgun Loader + SA Finder, Bow Reloader + Primary Ammo Finder
Armor #2: Shotgun Loader + SA Finder, Bow Reloader + Scout Rifle Scavenger
That means that out of 4 possible combination each piece can make it only has 1 combination available. That is SG Loader + SA Finder and the other 3 combinations are useless as far as it's configured.
Now it might suggest you delete piece #1 and #2 because they cover for each other but in reality they're also both marked for deletion, so it's saying yeah delete #1 bc it has that 1 good combo but 1 other piece has it and then assuming you don't delete #1 it's saying, delete #2 it's fine another piece can cover that one combo.
I could fix it so it would only show one but at that point it's subjective which one you want to keep so I rather have it show me both. 
So to improve certainty while dismantling items I added the number of armor pieces that have that armor combination in the report so that you may use DIM to look up and verify it's not this situation.
- I will improve the perk count system by including a warning or a symbol or a note if the perk combination has an armor count of 0 if it includes all the pieces marked for deletion.

[Benefits]
- I started doing this to make space in my vault and help me figure out what's worth deleting.
- This has evolved in other benefits such as increasing the light level of all my existing armor using only glimmer
- My rule of thumb is if the armor piece marked for deletion is 20 light levels higher than my lowest light level piece of the same type (631 Prodigal Cloak) and I have a 520 cloak in the vault I can go ahead and infuse the 520 with the only exception is if it has a mod then I'll delete it.
- Less hassle having to analyze every perk and keep mental note of what you have and don't have and what's useful and not useful and what the names are for and what they mean.
- Armor collection starts to evolve into more meaningful and useful overall perks with the eventual goal of having armor sets where every perk and perk combination in it is considered useful.

[DIM Integration]
- It'd be cool if I could port this to DIM as a filter, something like has:dupeperk and it'll highlight which ones you can safely delete using all this logic with options in settings to control which rules you want enabled.
- I looked into the DIM source and I found the one file I'd have to modify but I'm not very familiar with everything involved so I've been focusing on refining the logic and rules before I consider porting it.
- If anyone wants to jump in and help by all means I'm sure the community would find this more useful as a DIM filter.

[Install Instructions]
- Visit my Github project
- Download the zip file 
- Extract it anywhere you want
- Keep a note of where it is because you have to put your armor file into it
- Visit the NodeJS website and install the latest LTS version available for your system.

[Usage Instructions]
- Make sure DIM is refreshed and up to date
- Click the Cog wheel to visit Settings
- Scroll to the bottom 
- Click on Armor under Spreadsheets
- File will be downloaded to your system
- Copy this file to the place you extracted the project overwriting the existing destinyArmor.csv file
- On Windows simply click create_report.bat, on any other system run the command "node index.js" in that folder.
- Report.txt file will be created/updated in that folder with the latest armor pieces that can be deleted.
- Rinse and repeat as you get new armor just put in the vault for later review.
